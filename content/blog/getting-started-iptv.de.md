Whether you’re new to streaming or you’ve just signed up with StreamAtlas, getting started doesn’t have to be complicated. In this guide we walk you through everything you need: from choosing a plan to watching your first channel. No technical jargon—just clear, step-by-step instructions so you can start enjoying live TV and on-demand content in no time.


## Introduction: What is IPTV and why it’s worth it

IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) delivers live TV and on-demand content over the internet instead of a cable or satellite dish. You use an app on your TV, phone, or tablet and stream whatever you want, whenever you want. The main advantages are flexibility, a huge choice of channels, and often lower costs than traditional TV. Once your subscription is active, setup usually takes only a few minutes.


## What you need before you start

A few things will make your first experience smooth and trouble-free.

**A stable internet connection.** We recommend at least 10 Mbps for HD streaming; for 4K, 25 Mbps or more is ideal. If you can watch Netflix or YouTube without buffering, you’re good to go.

**A compatible device.** That can be a Smart TV, an Android box, a Fire Stick, a phone, a tablet, or a computer. Our service works on all of them, so you can start with whatever you already have.

**Your subscription credentials.** As soon as your payment is confirmed, we send you a link, username, and password. Keep them handy—you’ll need them in the app.


## Step 1: Choose your plan and complete payment

Head to our [pricing page](/pricing) and pick the plan that fits you best: monthly, a few months, or yearly. All plans include the same channel lineup and features; the longer plans simply save you more.

After you pay, you’ll receive your login details by email or WhatsApp, usually within minutes. No waiting for a technician or a box in the mail—everything is digital and instant.


## Step 2: Install an IPTV app on your device

Next, you need an app that can play IPTV streams. These are free and easy to find.

- **Smart TV or Android TV:** Open the app store on your TV and search for **IPTV Smarters** or **Tivimate**. Install one of them—both work great with our service.
- **Amazon Fire Stick or Fire TV:** Go to the Amazon Appstore, search for **IPTV Smarters** or **Tivimate**, and install.
- **Phone or tablet:** On iOS or Android, install **IPTV Smarters** or **GSE Smart IPTV** from the App Store or Google Play.

Don’t worry about choosing the “wrong” app. They all do the same job: they take your credentials and show you the channel list. You can try another app later if you like.


## Step 3: Add your subscription and start watching

Open the app you installed. Look for an option like “Add playlist,” “Add subscription,” or “Login.” Enter the URL, username, and password we sent you. Save the profile, and the app will load the channel list.

Within a few seconds you should see all your channels. Pick one and enjoy. No extra setup is required—if you see the list, you’re done.


## Tips for the best experience

- **Use wired internet for your TV when possible.** A cable from your router to the TV or box reduces lag and buffering.
- **Restart the app if something doesn’t load.** Sometimes a quick restart fixes temporary glitches.
- **Keep your credentials safe.** Don’t share your login details; one subscription is for your personal use.
